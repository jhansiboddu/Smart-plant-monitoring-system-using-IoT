By integrating sensors for soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and motion detection, the system ensures real-time monitoring of plant conditions. 
The blynk app facilitates remote monitoring and alerts, enabling users to monitor their plants from anywhere. 
This innovative approach not only improves efficiency in plant care but also empowers users with actionable insights for better plant management.

The system continuously monitors key parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and motion around the plants using integrated sensors. 
When the soil moisture level falls below a preset threshold, indicating the need for watering, the system activates a water pump to irrigate the plants automatically.
Simultaneously, sensor data is processed and displayed on the system that is integrated with the Blynk app, allowing users to remotely monitor sensor readings and receive alerts on their smartphones.
The Blynk app enables users to access detailed historical data, set custom alerts, and adjust watering schedules based on plant needs.
